Computational Thinking to add dark/light mode switching: 
1. Break the problem into smaller parts
    - Create a dropdown to switch modes
    - Create CSS classes for dark and light modes
    - Add event listener to dropdown to toggle classes
2. Look for repeated or similar steps
3. Make a list of steps
    - Create dropdown element in HTML
    - Define CSS classes for dark and light modes
    - Use JavaScript to add event listener to dropdown
    - In event listener, toggle the CSS classes on the body element
